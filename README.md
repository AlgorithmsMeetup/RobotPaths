###Robot Paths
Imagine an n by m grid with a robot in the upper left square.  If the robot can only move right or down, how many different paths are there for the robot to get to the bottom right corner?

What if there are obstacles in the way?  What if the robot could also move up or left, but not visit the same space twice?  Can you make it work for very large grids?
